Certainly! Let's explore some of the core functions in Bokeh along with their syntax and purpose:

### 1. `figure()` function

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure

plot = figure(title='Title', x_axis_label='X Label', y_axis_label='Y Label')
```

**Purpose:**
The `figure()` function initializes a figure for plotting. It sets up the basic parameters such as title, axis labels, and other properties of the plot.

### 2. Glyphs (e.g., `circle()`, `line()`, `square()`)

**Syntax:**
```python
plot.circle(x, y, size=10, color='blue', alpha=0.5)
```

**Purpose:**
Glyphs are visual markers used to represent data points on the plot. 
Bokeh provides various glyph functions (`circle()`, `line()`, `square()`, etc.) to plot different types of markers with customizable attributes like size, color, and transparency.

### 3. `show()` function

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.io import show

show(plot)
```

**Purpose:**
The `show()` function displays the plot object (`plot` in this case) in a web browser or in a Jupyter notebook if used there. 
It renders the plot that has been set up and configured using Bokeh.

### 4. `output_file()` function

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.io import output_file

output_file('plot.html')
```

**Purpose:**
The `output_file()` function specifies where the plot should be saved as an HTML file (`plot.html` in this example). 
This function is used before calling `show()` to save the plot to a file.

### 5. `ColumnDataSource()` function

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.plotting import ColumnDataSource

source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=x_data, y=y_data))
```

**Purpose:**
`ColumnDataSource` is a fundamental data structure in Bokeh that maps column names to sequences of data. 
It is used to provide data to glyphs in an efficient and convenient manner, especially when dealing with large datasets or when updating plots dynamically.

### 6. Widgets (e.g., `Slider`, `Button`, `CheckboxGroup`)

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.models import Slider

slider = Slider(start=0, end=100, value=50, step=1, title='Slider')
```

**Purpose:**
Bokeh provides a variety of interactive widgets (`Slider`, `Button`, `CheckboxGroup`, etc.) that can be added to plots or layouts. 
These widgets allow users to interactively control aspects of the plot, such as filtering data or adjusting parameters.

### 7. `layouts` and `gridplot()` function

**Syntax:**
```python
from bokeh.layouts import gridplot

layout = gridplot([[plot1, plot2], [plot3, plot4]], sizing_mode='stretch_both')
```

**Purpose:**
`gridplot()` is used to arrange multiple plots into a grid layout. It helps in creating complex dashboard-like layouts where multiple plots or widgets are displayed together in a structured grid.

### 8. `bokeh.server` module

**Purpose:**
Bokeh's server capabilities enable the creation of interactive, real-time data applications. 
By running a Bokeh server, applications can update and respond to user input dynamically, making it suitable for applications requiring live updates or streaming data.

These functions and concepts form the core of Bokeh's capabilities, enabling users to create sophisticated and interactive visualizations directly from Python. 
Each function serves a specific purpose in configuring plots, managing data, adding interactivity, or structuring layouts for web-based deployment.
